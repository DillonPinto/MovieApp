# MovieApp
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.3.


# Functionality implemented
  Login, register and save user sessions without requiring the user to log in again.
  Entity framework used to store user records/objects.
  All UI components implemented using the Angular material package
  Ability to create lists
  Ability to add a movie to list or remove movie from list

## Future improvements
Use the Angular material CDK virtual-scroll-viewport instead of the paginator for an efficient infinite scroll that only
renders the list items that are in view, allowing memory usage to be kept low.

Grid layout for a more efficient use of space.

Search engine optimization using Google Search Console (Web master tools) to index the site on Google and similar tools
for other major search engines.

Include common error codes (404, etc)

Implement a more efficient data structure for storing and retrieving movies (hashmap/set)
